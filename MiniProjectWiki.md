Notes log for EAD Mini Project.

# Introduction #

This project is an on-line dating web service with a Windows Phone App.


# Details #

The dating service will do the following:

1.	A database containing at least 1 table, SQL Azure or Oracle containing clients demographics.
2.	An ASP.Net MVC application which maintains the data in that database table i.e. list, edit, update, delete using the Entity Framework to be used by an administrator.
3.	A web service (REST) which provides access to a piece of analysis which will compare the clients information and get a match.
4.	A simple Windows Phone client for the web service which calls the operation and displays the result.
